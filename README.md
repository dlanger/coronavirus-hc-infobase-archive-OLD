_Certain data files came to be >100MB, requiring the use of [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/). GitHub actions [can't](https://github.com/dlanger/coronavirus-hc-infobase-archive-OLD/runs/728622615?check_suite_focus=true) upload lfs files to public forks, so I've recreated this repository without it being a fork._
